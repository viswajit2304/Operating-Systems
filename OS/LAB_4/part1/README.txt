This text file conatains some assumptions that i took while implementing the code.
1) While implementing LRU if the process that has to loaded from Main memory to virtual memory has more size than the reaming virtual size? I ignored this case. Just have to print an error msg.
2) Some error messages are not printed assuming that they will be neglected.
3) I am printing everything in the outputFile.
4) In all my input files delimiters are required, they may not run in the wsl terminal.
